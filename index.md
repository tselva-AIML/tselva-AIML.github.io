# AI/ML Portfolio - Selvakumar Thirumalainambi

Welcome to my portfolio, showcasing projects from my **Post Graduate Program in AI/ML** (March 2025). As an aspiring **AI/ML Engineer**, I specialize in **computer vision**, **predictive modeling**, and **data analysis**, with hands-on expertise in TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV. Certified in **Azure Data Scientist Associate**, **AWS Certified AI Practitioner**, and **Power BI Data Analyst**, Iâ€™m passionate about building AI-driven solutions to solve real-world challenges. Explore my projects below, complete with source code, interactive notebooks, and datasets hosted on GitHub.

## Featured Project

- **[Plant Seedling Classification](/projects/plant-seedling-classification)**: Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with **98% accuracy** to classify plant seedlings and weeds, automating agricultural processes to enhance crop yields. Built for the **Introduction to Computer Vision** course using TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV. ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/tselva-AIML/AI-ML-Portfolio/plant-seedling-classification))
