# Plant Seedling Classification

**Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plant seedlings and weeds with 98% accuracy, automating agricultural processes to enhance crop yields.**

Completed for the **Introduction to Computer Vision** course as part of my **Post Graduate Program in AI/ML** (March 2025), this project leverages **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **OpenCV** to achieve **98% accuracy** on a multi-class dataset. It demonstrates my expertise in image processing, deep learning, and model evaluation, aligning with my certifications in **Azure Data Scientist Associate**, **AWS Certified AI Practitioner**, and **Power BI Data Analyst**.

## Project Highlights

- **Objective**: Automate the classification of plant seedlings and weeds to improve crop management and reduce manual effort in agriculture.
