# Plant Seedling Classification

**Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plant seedlings and weeds with 98% accuracy, automating agricultural processes to enhance crop yields.**

Completed for the **Introduction to Computer Vision** course as part of my **Post Graduate Program in AI/ML** (March 2025), this project leverages **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **OpenCV** to achieve **98% accuracy** on a multi-class dataset. It demonstrates my expertise in image processing, deep learning, and model evaluation, aligning with my certifications in **Azure Data Scientist Associate**, **AWS Certified AI Practitioner**, and **Power BI Data Analyst**.

## Project Highlights

- **Objective**: Automate the classification of plant seedlings and weeds to improve crop management and reduce manual effort in agriculture.
- **Performance**: Achieved **98% accuracy** with balanced precision, recall, and F1-scores, validated through confusion matrices and performance metrics.
- **Dataset**: 222 MB NumPy dataset (`seedlings.npy`) hosted on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/INSERT_YOUR_FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing), with a 10 MB sample dataset (`sample_seedlings.npy`) for accessibility.
- **Visualizations**: Confusion matrices and accuracy plots available in an interactive [HTML Notebook](https://github.com/tselva-AIML/AI-ML-Portfolio/raw/main/plant-seedling-classification/visuals/plant_seedling_notebook.html).

## Skills & Tools

- **Technologies**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Techniques**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), transfer learning, image preprocessing, data imbalance handling, model evaluation
- **Learnings**:
  - Designed and trained a CNN for multi-class image classification.
  - Applied image preprocessing techniques (BGR to RGB conversion, resizing, normalization) using OpenCV.
  - Handled imbalanced datasets to ensure robust model performance.
  - Evaluated model performance using accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score metrics.

## Artifacts

- **Source Code**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/tselva-AIML/AI-ML-Portfolio/plant-seedling-classification) – Full codebase, including model training and evaluation scripts.
- **Interactive Notebook**: [HTML Notebook](https://github.com/tselva-AIML/AI-ML-Portfolio/raw/main/plant-seedling-classification/visuals/plant_seedling_notebook.html) – Visualizations and code walkthrough.
- **Dataset**: [seedlings.npy (222 MB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/INSERT_YOUR_FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing) – Complete dataset for reproducibility.
